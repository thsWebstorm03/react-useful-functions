# Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Samples Library

This repository contains a collection of samples showcasing some typical uses of Cloud Functions using the Firebase SDK for CLoud Functions.


## Prerequisites

To learn how to get started with the Firebase SDKL for Cloud Functions try the quickstart samples and have a look at [the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/preview/functions/).


## Use Cases and Samples

This repository contains the following samples:

Uses a Firebase Storage trigger.

### [Automatically Moderate Images](/moderate-images)

Demonstrates how to automatically moderate offensive images that are uploaded to Firebase Storage by using the Google Cloud Vision API to detect offensive images and ImageMagick to blur these images.

Uses a Firebase Storage trigger.

### [Extract Image Metadata](/exif-images)

### [Webhook upon Database writes](/minimal-webhook)

Writing to the Database triggers a request to a callback URL (a Webhook). The content of the modified Data is sent to the Webhook.

Uses an Realtime Database trigger.

### [Firebase Database Child Nodes Count](/child-count)

Keeps track of the number of child nodes of a Firebase Database element allowing clients to filter or order results using the child count.
This can be useful to keep tack of the number of "likes" or "followers" of a somethings shares through social media.
