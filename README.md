# Firebase Cloud Functions Templates Library

This repository contains a collection of templates showcasing some typical uses of Firebase Cloud Functions.


## Prerequisites

To learn how to get started with Cloud Functions and Firebase try the quickstarts ([Web](https://devrel.git.corp.google.com/samples/firebase/quickstart/web/+/master/gcf/), [Android](https://devrel.git.corp.google.com/samples/firebase/quickstart/android/+/master/functions/)) and have a look at [the documentation](https://developers.google.com/firebase/docs/cloud-functions/setup).

## Use Cases and Samples

This repository contains the following templates:

### [Text Moderation](/text-moderation)

How to moderate user input text for bad words. For example this can be used to moderate usernames, chat or forum messages.

### [LastModified Firebase Database tracking](/lastmodified-tracking)

Tracking when the Firebase Database (or a subset) was last modified.

### [Webhook upon Database writes](/minimal-webhook)

### [Firebase Database Child Nodes Count](/child-count)

Keeps track of the number of child nodes of a Firebase Database element allowing clients to filter or order results using the child count.

### [Automatic message translation](/message-translation)
