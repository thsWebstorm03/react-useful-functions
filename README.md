# Firebase Functions Samples Library

This repository contains a collection of samples showcasing some typical uses of Firebase Functions.


## Prerequisites

To learn how to get started with Firebase Functions try the [quickstart samples](https://devrel.git.corp.google.com/samples/firebase/quickstart/functions/) and have a look at [the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/preview/functions/).


## Use Cases and Samples

This repository contains the following samples:

### [Authorize with LinkedIn](/linkedin-auth)

Demonstrates how to authorize with a 3rd party sign-in mechanism (LinkedIn in this case), create a Firebase custom auth token, update the user's profile and authorize Firebase.

### [Text Moderation](/text-moderation)

How to moderate user input text for bad words. For example this can be used to moderate usernames, chat or forum messages.

### [Email Confirmation](/email-confirmation)

Sends email confirmation after users subscribed to a mailing list.

### [LastModified Firebase Database tracking](/lastmodified-tracking)

Tracking when the Firebase Database (or a subset) was last modified.

### [Webhook upon Database writes](/minimal-webhook)

Writing to the Database triggers a request to a callback URL (a Webhook). The content of the modified Data is sent to the Webhook.

### [Firebase Database Child Nodes Count](/child-count)

Keeps track of the number of child nodes of a Firebase Database element allowing clients to filter or order results using the child count.
This can be useful to keep tack of the number of "likes" or "followers" of a somethings shares through social media.

### [Automatic message translation](/message-translation)

Integrates the Google Translate API to perform automatic text translation across any number of languages. Language codes can be stored in Firebase for on the fly changes.

### [Limit number of child nodes](/limit-children)

Make sure to keep the number of child nodes below a certain threshold. For instance this can be useful to limit the number of lines of logs or chat history below a given number.

### [Import Data to Big Query](/bigquery-import)

Copies Firebase Database elements into BigQuery automatically. This can be useful for instance for further logs analysis.

### [Full-text search via Algolia](/fulltext-search)
