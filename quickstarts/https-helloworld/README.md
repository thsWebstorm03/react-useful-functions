# Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Quickstart - HTTPS trigger

This quickstart demonstrates using the **Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions** with an HTTPS trigger.


## Introduction

We'll show a series of basic HTTPS triggered Functions.

## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

### 1. Clone this repo

Clone or download this repo and open the `http` directory.


### 2. Create a Firebase project and configure the quickstart

Create a Firebase Project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

Set up your Firebase project by running `firebase use --add`, select your Project ID and follow the instructions.


### 3. Install the Firebase CLI and enable Functions on your Firebase CLI

You need to have installed the Firebase CLI. If you haven't already run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

> Doesn't work? You may need to [change npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).


## Deploy the app to prod

First you need to install the `npm` dependencies of the functions:

```bash
cd functions && npm install; cd ..
```

This installs locally the Firebase SDK and the Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions.

Deploy to Firebase using the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

This deploys and activate the date Function.

> The first time you call `firebase deploy` on a new project with Functions will take longer than usual.


## Try the sample
